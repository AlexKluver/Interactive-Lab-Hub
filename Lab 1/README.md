# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.
3. (extra: Learn about what exactly Git is from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).)

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Part A. Plan 


\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

When originally brainstorming, our group decided to use the idea of an alarm clock that utilizes light instead of a jarring noise that most alarm clocks use. The implementation of our alarm clock allows the user to wake up at any time or in any place while the alarm clock mimics a natural sunrise. The user of the alarm clock, or in better terms a "Sunrise Clock" is also able to select the preferred type of simulated weather for their sunrise, so that if someone that lives in a sunny area of the world is able to wake up as if it were a rainy day outside. 

Utilizing the Sunrise Clock, people that live in areas such as Alaska, where in the summer it stays light 24 hours of the day, and in the winter it stays dark at all times, could wake up to a light that mimics a natural sunrise.

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*

As a group, we went through severeal iterations of storyboards to make sure that our drawings displayed the way that we intended our sunrise clock to work. These storyboard iterations are shown below:

![image2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89855265/132140123-2565914f-1330-4e80-b0db-67caaff658cb.jpg)
![image3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89855265/132140124-e4f7ec9a-6871-4ee4-a49b-96582ebb4300.jpg)



\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

The idea that we originally came up with only woke up users with a bright white light, not mimicing any natual light given off by the sun. We realized that this bright white light will end up being just as jarring as the alarm, so we decided to have it slowly get brighter and be able to mimic a natural sunrise that ultilizes different color and brightness settings for the users weather preferences.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

We experienced some issues with the light source from the tinkerbell application not being bright enough to actually wake someone, or make a noticable lighting difference even in the dark. To combat this issue, we utilized additional light sources so that there is a noticable difference in brightness as the time goes onwards so that it would actually be bright enough to wake someone up.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

Similar to what was stated in the previous question, we needed to use a stronger light source in order to project the desired amount of light throughout the room. Since the additional light sources that we had available only had a single 'on' setting with the no color options, this made it so that we were unable to display the additional lighting preferences that we intended the device to have.

In addition to the device being able to wake someone up with a natural looking light, we had discussed the device also being able to change colors depending on the weather outside, effectively acting as a thermometer. This part would only come into effect after the user has already woken, since if it began before the user is awake, it would defeat the original purpose of the device.

Below is an additional photo showing us setting up for the video interaction:

## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

In my experience using the tinkerbell program, I found that it was not very compatible with the school wifi, as the wifi sets up profiles for each device that is connected to the network, making it a much more diffucult process to be able to connect the laptop to a phone to display the tinkerbell program. We resorted to using personal hotspot to avoid these wifi network problems. 

## Part D. Wizard the device

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

Between the two takes, we decided that the blinds did in the apartment at the house were not sufficient in blocking out the light, so as shown in the picture above in part B, we had Lauren and Maggie attempt to block out the sun coming through the window with a sheet. In addition to this, we attempted to use a projector to increase the amount of light from the device, but instead we decided that we would just use the natural light that we already had since it was mid-day.

## Part E. Costume the device

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

Below is the original sketch and cutout of what we would imagine the device to look like. The 3 colored buttons on top are to select the weather mimicing preferences of the user, and the yellow paper coming off of the top is signifying light being emitted from the device.

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

We wanted the user to have minimal interaction with the device so that they have a more pleasant experience waking up opposed to the traditional alarm clock method. To minimize interaction, we incorporated 3 buttons corresponding to preset weather preferences on a regular looking alarm clock device.

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

The feedback I have received from others on our sunrise alarm was very positive. The most common concern that was expressed from the peer review was that there would not be a significant enough amount of light to wake someone. A suggested fix to this light problem was to hook up the device to the room lights, that way it would provide a significant amount of lighting. The problem with this suggestion is that then the light color would not be customizable and would be stuck with the color that the room lighting is. Another concern expressed with our device was that it would only work well with a single user, and that the users partner would also be woken up by our device when the lights are turned on. This is an aspecct we discussed as a group and could be fixed by embedding the device into a sleep mask, this way it would not disturb others in the room.  

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*

## Part 2A. Plan 

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

Our group has made the decision to use the same general idea of a sunrise alarm with additional improvements based on the peer feedback we received from our classmates. We are still going to make a light-based alarm, but instead we have decided to embed the device into a sleeping mask. By embedding the device into a sleep mask, we are solving the problem with the device lighting not being bright enough to wake someone and we also solve the problem with our device accidentily waking someone else in the room. As an additional feature for the device, we are adding vibration to the mask to give the user another reason to wake up.

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*
This iteration of our design had much less problems than our first iteration that we acted out in part 1 of the lab. Since we did not require to have the room dark to display the function of the device, the entire process went much smoother.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
While we were filming the device interaction, one good idea that was mentioned was that instead of having the sleeping mask have set options to choose from for light colors, instead it should be either voice activated to choose the desired color and time to wake up, or to choose the desired color on a color wheel and set the time to wake the same way alarms are usually set

## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
During this iteration of the lab, we decided to not use the tinkerbell software that was provided to us, since the process to get it to work properly was far too long for a feature that could easily be google searched.

## Part E. Costume the device

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*
As seen in the provided pictures, we have changed the design of our alarm clock so that it is integrated into a sleeping mask, solving the problem of the light source not being powerful enough to wake up someone if the alarm clock is not near them

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
We wanted our device to look like a traditional sleep mask used to block out the light while one sleeps.

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*
